    description: "We utilized COMSOL simulation software to simulate the absorption performance of designed acoustic structures. By analyzing the simulation results (e.g., absorption peaks and sound pressure distribution), we adjusted the structural parameters to optimize their acoustic performance. Once the simulation results are optimized, we used a 3D printer to fabricate the corresponding acoustic metamaterials. These samples are then placed in an impedance tube for experimental measurement to evaluate their actual sound absorption effectiveness.",
